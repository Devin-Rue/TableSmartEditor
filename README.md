# TableSmartEditor

Git repository to show intern work experience. I was granted permission by my supervisor to send myself a copy of my work. Commits under the alias "Nheat" are also from me.

My work can be found in index.aspx, index.aspx.cs, web.config, HtmlToPdf.aspx.cs, and css/cms.css. I always commented my code, and always tried to include my name (Devin) whenever I added comments, but some non-Italian comments may also be my own.

This project is not setup to function outside of the organization, and is only meant to showcase source code. Screenshots of the project in use may be seen in the documentation, however.

Attached is documentation I wrote on the project intended for both end users and developers:
